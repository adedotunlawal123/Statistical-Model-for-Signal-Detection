**Statistical-Model-for-Signal-Detection**

**Background** 

Wind is a major agent in infrasound transmission and detection, and tornadoes emit infrasonic signals. However, winds have non-deterministic behavior; hence prediction of infrasound transmission and detection is almost impossible.


**Aim**

The code aims to provide a statistical model for signal (infrasonic) detection and probability density estimation of transmission loss, a measure of infrasound loss. This will predict what locations an infrasound sensor will be useful for watching for tornadoes. And is part of a project that aims to develop early warning systems for tornadoes.
