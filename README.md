**Statistical-Model-for-Signal-Detection**

**Background** 

Wind is a major agent in infrasound transmission and detection, and tornadoes emit infrasonic signals. However, winds have non-deterministic behavior; hence prediction of infrasound transmission and detection is almost impossible.


**Aim**

The code aims to provide a statistical model for signal (infrasonic) detection and probability density estimation of transmission loss, a measure of infrasound loss. This can be used alongside a noise model for a sensor to predict what locations an infrasound sensor will be useful. This will help to develop early warning systems for tornadoes. https://news.olemiss.edu/um-researchers-working-detect-track-tornadoes/

**Sponsor**

This project is sponsored by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to watch for tornadoes.
