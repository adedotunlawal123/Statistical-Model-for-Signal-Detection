**Statistical Model for-Signal-Detection**
==========================================

**Background** 
==================

Wind is a major agent in infrasound transmission and detection, and tornadoes emit infrasonic signals. However, winds have non-deterministic behavior; hence prediction of infrasound detection is almost impossible.


**Aim**
=========

The code aims to provide a statistical model for signal (infrasonic) detection and probability density estimation of transmission loss, a measure of infrasound attenuation, for the prediction of infrasound detection. It will be implemented to develop early warning systems for tornadoes. https://news.olemiss.edu/um-researchers-working-detect-track-tornadoes/

**Prerequisite**
====================
1. ncpaprop https://github.com/chetzer-ncpa/ncpaprop-release/

..* This should be installed to simulate infrasonic transmission loss during propagation.

**Sponsor**
=============

This project is sponsored by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to watch for tornadoes, thus saving lives.
